## Installation

You need python3:

```

Copy `euapw.py` anywhere convenient.

## Usage

It will generate random alphanumeric strings and mark those that EUA would
reject as "failed", and stop when a string matches the rule set.

```console
$ python3 euapw.py
failed 1MtIhKhA
passed qJbcNJ2Y
```

## Development

You need poetry:

```console
brew install poetry
```

Inside the project directory you can enter a virtual environment like so:

```console
poetry shell
```
